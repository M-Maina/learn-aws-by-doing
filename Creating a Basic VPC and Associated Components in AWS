Introduction
AWS networking consists of multiple components, and understanding the relationship between the networking components is a key part of understanding the overall functionality and capabilities of AWS. In this hands-on lab, we will create a VPC with an internet gateway, as well as create subnets across multiple Availability Zones.

Solution
Log in to the live AWS environment using the credentials provided. Make sure you're in the N. Virginia (us-east-1) region throughout the lab.

Note: This guide follows a different order than the solution videos, but the results are the same.

Create a VPC
Navigate to VPC.

In the sidebar menu, navigate to Virtual private cloud and select Your VPCs.

On the right, click Create VPC.

Configure the VPC settings:

Name tag: In the text field, enter vpc1.
IPv4 CIDR block: In the text field, enter 172.16.0.0/16.
Leave the other settings as the defaults and click Create VPC.

The VPC is created but does not have an internet gateway, subnets, or any other functionality.

Create a Public and Private Subnet in Different Availability Zones
In the sidebar menu, select Subnets.

On the right, click Create subnet.

Configure the public subnet:

VPC ID: Use the dropdown to select vpc1.
Subnet name: In the text field, enter Public1.
Availability Zone: Use the dropdown to select us-east-1a.
IPv4 CIDR block: In the field, select 172.16.1.0/24. Any EC2 instances assigned to this subnet will have an IP address prefix of 172.16.1.
Click Create subnet.

The public subnet is created.

On the right, click Create subnet again.

Configure the private subnet:

VPC ID: Use the dropdown to select vpc1.
Subnet name: In the text field, enter Private1.
Availability Zone: Use the dropdown to select us-east-1b.
IPv4 CIDR block: In the field, select 172.16.2.0/24.
Click Create subnet.

The private subnet is created.

Create Two Network Access Control Lists (NACLs), and Associate Each With the Proper Subnet
Create and Configure a Public NACL
In the sidebar menu, navigate to Security and select Network ACLs.

You should see a default NACL available. However, you won't use this NACL.

On the right, click Create network ACL.

Configure the public NACL:

Name: In the text field, enter PublicNACL.
VPC: Use the dropdown to select vpc1.
Click Create network ACL.

After the NACL is created, check the checkbox next to PublicNACL.

Select the Inbound rules tab and then click Edit inbound rules.

Add two inbound rules:

Click Add new rule.
Fill in the rule details:
Rule number: In the text field, enter 100.
Type: Use the dropdown to select HTTP (80).
Source: Leave the source as 0.0.0.0/0.
Click Add new rule again.
Fill in the rule details:
Rule number: In the text field, enter 110.
Type: Use the dropdown to select SSH (22).
Source: Leave the source as 0.0.0.0/0.
Click Save changes.

From the PublicNACL details, select the Outbound rules tab and then click Edit outbound rules.

Add an outbound rule:

Click Add new rule.
Fill in the rule details:
Rule number: In the text field, enter 100.
Type: Leave the type as Custom TCP.
Port range: In the text field, enter 1024-65535.
Destination: Leave the destination as 0.0.0.0/0.
Click Save changes.

From the PublicNACL details, select the Subnet associations tab and then click Edit subnet associations.

Check the checkbox next to the Public1 subnet.

Click Save changes to associate your public NACL with the public subnet.

Create and Configure a Private NACL
From the Network ACLs page, click Create network ACL.
Configure the private NACL:
Name: In the text field, enter PrivateNACL.
VPC: Use the dropdown to select vpc1.
Click Create network ACL.
Check the checkbox next to PrivateNACL, ensuring that it's the only NACL selected.
Select the Inbound rules tab and then click Edit inbound rules.
Add an inbound rule:
Click Add new rule.
Fill in the rule details:
Rule number: In the text field, enter 100.
Type: Use the dropdown to select SSH (22).
Source: In the text field, enter 172.16.1.0/24.
Click Save changes.
From the PrivateNACL details, select the Outbound rules tab and then click Edit outbound rules.
Add an outbound rule:
Click Add new rule.
Fill in the rule details:
Rule number: In the text field, enter 100.
Type: Leave the type as Custom TCP.
Port range: In the text field, enter 1024-65535.
Destination: Leave the destination as 0.0.0.0/0.
Click Save changes.
From the PrivateNACL details, select the Subnet associations tab and then click Edit subnet associations.
Check the checkbox next to the Private1 subnet.
Click Save changes to associate your private NACL with the private subnet.
Create an Internet Gateway, and Connect It to the VPC
In the sidebar menu, navigate to Virtual private cloud and select Internet gateways.

On the right, click Create internet gateway.

In the Name tag field, enter IGW.

Click Create internet gateway.

After the internet gateway is created, use the Actions dropdown to select Attach to VPC.

In the Available VPCs field, select vpc1.

Click Attach internet gateway.

Your internet gateway should now be in an Attached state.

Create Two Route Tables, and Associate Them with the Correct Subnet
Create the Route Tables
In the sidebar menu, select Route tables.

You should see a default route table available. However, you will not use this route table.

On the right, click Create route table.

Configure the public route table:

Name: In the text field, enter PublicRT.
VPC: Use the dropdown to select vpc1.
Click Create route table.

In the sidebar menu, select Route tables again.

On the right, click Create route table.

Configure the private route table:

Name: In the text field, enter PrivateRT.
VPC: Use the dropdown to select vpc1.
Click Create route table.

Associate the Route Tables with the Correct Subnet
In the sidebar menu, select Route tables again.
Check the checkbox next to the PublicRT route table, ensuring that this is the only route table selected.
Add a route to the internet gateway:
Select the Routes tab and click Edit routes.

Click Add route to add a route to the internet gateway.

In the Destination field, select 0.0.0.0/0.

In the Target field, select Internet Gateway, and then select the igw gateway.

Click Save changes.

Now, any traffic that's not destined for the local network will be routed to the internet gateway.

In the sidebar menu, select Route tables again and ensure the checkbox next to PublicRT is checked.
Associate the route table with the public subnet:
Select the Subnet associations tab.
In the Subnets without explicit associations section, click Edit subnet associations.
Check the checkbox next to the Public1 subnet.
Click Save associations.
In the sidebar menu, select Route tables again.
Check the checkbox next to the PrivateRT route table, ensuring that this is the only route table selected.
Select the Routes tab and note that the local route already exists. For this route table, you don't need to create another route to the internet gateway.
Associate the route table with the private subnet:
Select the Subnet associations tab.
In the Subnets without explicit associations section, click Edit subnet associations.
Check the checkbox next to the Private1 subnet.
Click Save associations.
